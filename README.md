## Introduction
Space Taxi is a 2D arcade-style game where you control a taxi navigating through space. Your objective is to land safely on platforms while managing fuel and avoiding obstacles.

## Prerequisites
Before running the game, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pygame library

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/moelhaj996/Taxi-gam.git
    cd Taxi-gam
    ```

2. **Install the Pygame library:**
    ```sh
    pip install pygame
    ```

3. **Ensure the asset files are in the correct directory:**
    The sound files (`thrust.wav`, `land.wav`, `game_over.wav`) should be located in the `assets/sounds` directory.

Game Controls
